# GIFTastic
This is a simple app that allows you to search for GIF's by typing them into the search box and it returns a certian number to you (in this case 10).
this uses the Giphy API and its q= search feature.
It also is set to retreive only 10 gif's
The Gif's start out still and will move once clicked.
click again and it will stop
